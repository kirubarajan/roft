      "The new law ''will further empower parents to protect their children, prevent dangerous criminals from escaping the state's stringent registration requirements and ensure full federal funding for important community-based programs,'' said Senator Dean G. Skelos, the bill's sponsor.",
      "The bill that was passed today will add to the registry people convicted of several relatively low-level sex crimes, like sexual misconduct, which applies to sexual contact without penetration.",
      "Some of the crimes added to the list were designated as crimes last year by the Legislature and the governor, including persistent sexual abuse.",

      "But generating about 120 hours of live television from an event that maintains no fixed address poses more than the usual share of technical problems.",
      "Peter Sumpf, the vice president for network operations at the Outdoor Life Network, or OLN, which is presenting daily live broadcasts of the Tour in the United States, has coordinated coverage of nearly every kind of sport during a career that includes 18 years at ESPN. ''",

      "Sampras hadn't faltered in an opening round match since he visited this same event last year.",
      "Despite a flawed performance at the very site that five years ago brought him the first of his 30 career titles, Sampras squeaked out of trouble with a 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 comeback.",
