      You will be presented with the starting sentence of an article, story, or other document. This sentence will ALWAYS be written by a human.
      Then, you will be shown continuation sentences one at a time.
      As some point, the sentences will transition from being written by a human writer to being generated by the computer.
      Your goal is to guess this boundary by clicking the appropriate button as soon as you are confident.
